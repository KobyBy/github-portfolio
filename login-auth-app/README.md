# login-authentication

This app was a challenge due to a difficulty often found in the world of Computer Science: misinformation. 
Our world is constantly getting changed and updated, which can make it quite difficult to learn some new concepts while using tutorials.

After plenty of troubleshooting and figuring out specific syntax to use when calling POSTs and GETs to the database, we were able to
create an application which creates new users and stores them in a database. We came up with our own hashing algorithms which can be 
seen in its simplicity in my code.

Still, I'm quite proud I was able to get this working with very little help other than from the professor when we all got cookies 
to store properly in our databases.

I have uploaded a picture of the signup page here, which will also detect if the passwords don't match or don't meet the criteria, 
or if the username is in use already.
