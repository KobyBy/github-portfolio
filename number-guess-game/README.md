# number-guessing-game

This was one of my earlier assignments when still figuring out React, but it was lots of fun to put together. 
In this game, the user offers up their name to be stored in a highscores list, then proceeds to guess a number
in the range of 1 to 100. Each time they enter a guess, it lets them know if they are higher or lower. When 
they correctly guess the number, their name will be stored in the database and their score is the number of 
guesses. Then they can view their score compared to other people who've played.

I have pulled up an image of the page where the user first enters their name.

Here is an image of what a user sees while playing the game.

This is what it will look like when they finish up a game and have now been directed to the highscores screen.
