Hello World! 

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio. My name is Koby Byington and I initially made this assignment for my Computer Science 3750 course in my senior year of college, and wanted to share many of the projects I either did myself or participated with a group in. 

My first game was made near the start of my class
