# banking-app

This app was a combination of a few concepts we'd learned through the semester such as lists under a common user, login authentication, and overall 
logic manipulating database information. The user needed to login or signup if they don't have an account, which would look like this and was done 
by my teammate:

The user would then be greeted by this page displaying their account with three bank products: a Savings account, a Checking account, and a Credit 
account along with their balances.

My portion specifically was the transfers page. This should allow the user to deposit to one account, withdraw from an account, or transfer 
between accounts and properly send back the information to the database so it could be realized and recorded. The page turned out quite well as I 
experimented with dropdowns and added logic so they couldn't accidentally transfer to and from the same account as that would be ineffective.

The transaction history would pull up detailed information regarding all transactions by the user.
