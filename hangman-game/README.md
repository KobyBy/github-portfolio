# hangman-game

This was a great group project which I played my part well in. The goal was a simple game of hangman in which the user would be able to view highscores
categorized by the lengths of the words that were guessed. Inside of the game, the user should be able to see the length of the word based on a set of 
underscores.

My part in this project was to create the highscores page, but I ended up adding functional logic to the game page as well since my groupmate was unable
to figure some things out. Together this included dividing the scores by lengths of words, being able to seamlessly switch between the scores lists stored
in the database, while only showing the top 10 scores of each category, properly displaying the underscores for the length of the word in the game, 
showing all previously guessed letters that were correct or incorrect, and triggering the end of a game.

It all came together very well, the backend was functional quickly and everything triggers how it is supposed to. Before one starts a game, they are asked
their names for records and that is when they can begin guessing with a clean slate.

Here is an image of what it looks like when prompted for a name to start the game.

This is what the game looks like when it is being played.

When they have guessed some correct and some incorrect, they appear properly as follows.

When the game is finished, this is what it will look like, as they will have the option to play again or go to the highscores page.
